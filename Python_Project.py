    <h3>How The Web Works</h3>
    <p>The web is a collection of computer the communicate with each other to relay
    inormation. The computer uses <em>HTTP</em> to ask  <em>servers</em> for a
    particular webpage or <em>HTML Document</em>.
      </div>
    <br>
      <div class="L1">
      <h3>HTML</h3>
    <p><b>Html</b> is described a the "the heart of the web." Any and all webpages would
    not exist if not for HTML. HTML itself is made of <em>many</em> individual aspects
    to keep it together. The actual <b>text content</b> is what is seen and read on the
    webpage. The <b>markup</b> is how it is displayed on the webpage.</p>
      </div>
    <br>
      <div class="L1">
      <h3>HTML Markup</h3>
    <p>HTML markup is control by elements known as <em>tags</em> and <em>attributes</em>.
    <b>Tags</b> are used to alter the appearance of specific words or phrases. All tags
    are used in the middle of a "less than sign" and a "greater than sign". To make a
    word <b>bold</b>, you would use the "b" tag and to <em>italize</em>, the "em" tag
    would be used.<b>Attributes</b> are complementary assets to some tags. An anchor tag,
    for example, would be accompanied by the attribute "href", while "src" or search
    would be used for an image or "img" tag.</p>
      </div>
    <br>
      <div class="L1">
      <h3>Span and Div</h3>
    <p><b>Span</b> and <b>Div</b> are two classes that are used to contain a specific
    word or phrase. Div class is a <b>block</b> element, meaning it creates a "box"
    around the specified word or phrase. Span is an <b>inline</b> element, similar to
    "a","br","strong",etc.

    <h3>Learning how to learn</h3>
    <p>Learning how to do anything can be simplified into 4 relatively simple stages.
    The first stage would be <em>Ignorance</em> or "Stage 0." 0 is fitting for this
    stage because you know nothing at this stage. Stage 1 is the <em>Awareness</em>
    stage, which can be achieved by asking a simple question: What is that? Stage 2 is
    <em>Ability</em> which is just being able to do something at some level of
    competency. Stage 3 is <em>Fluency</em>, being able to do something in your sleep.
    </p>
     </div>
     <br>
     <div class="L1">
    <h3>Leave Mastery to the Masters</h3>
    <p>Fluency is not the current target, but it is still a goal. The current targets
    are Ability and Awareness. The reasoning is quite simple: the more you know about
    something and the more you do that, the quicker and easier it is to <em>master</em>
    it.</p>
        </div>
        <br>
        <div class="L1">
    <h3>Understanding the Language</h3>
    <p><b>HTML</b> and <b>CSS</b> are both languages that can be looked at as two sides
    of the same coin. HTML and the tags inside of it control the structure of the page.
    The structure of the page is what tells the browser what the content is and how to
    display it: text, picture, tag, etc. It's done by connecting several different
    elements into a tree-like "structure". CSS controls the style of the page, or the
    way it looks. The definition of language in this sense is a combination of
    <b>syntax</b> and <b>rules</b>.</p>

           '''<div class="L1">
        <h3>What not to do</h3>
        <p>The first lesson in using CSS is to avoid repetition! CSS standards for
        <b>Cascading Style Sheet</b>, which roughly translates to a sheet that takes
        the <em>most descriptive</em> rule that it is given and applies that rule to an
        html document. CSS sort of acts like a home decorator in a sense that it will
        customize the webpage to the specifications of the client.  </p>
      </div>
      <br>
        <div class="L1">
        <h3>How CSS works</h3>
        <p>CSS targets a specific class or tag by using a <b>selector</b>. Using a
        selector tells the CSS to target all classes or tags with this name and changes
        them according to the given rules. The rules provided to the CSS are
        <b>declarations</b> made up of a <b>property</b> and a <b>value</b>. </p>
      </div>
      <br>
        <div class="L1">
        <h3>How to use CSS</h3>
        <p>CSS can be used in a number of ways:</p>
         <ol>
          <li>Write it in to the initial HTML file through the in the head element,</li>
          <li>Link it in as a separate file all together,</li> <li>or Write it in the
          HTML with the corresponding element by inlining it, which is a bad idea, because
          it requires repetition for similar elements and that breaks Rule No. 1.</li>

        <h3>Computer Science</h3>
        <p>Computer science is problem solving, with computer. Specifically, how a
        computer solves a problem. Computers can do anything, as long as they have the
        proper <b>program (instructions)</b>, and a <b>precise sequence of steps</b> to
        tell the computer how to use those instructions. Once a computer receives those
        instructions, it <b>computes</b> the command and <b>executes</b> the programs.
        </p>
      </div>
      <br>
        <div class="L1">
        <h3>Computer Languages</h3>
        <p>Computers may display natural language, but they cannot run their programs on
        it. Natural languages have several <b>ambiguities</b>, which would confuse a
        computer and its programs. Therefore, computers have their own languages to run
        on known as <b>high-level language</b>. To translate the natural language that
        humans type into their computers, a computer <em>needs an interpreter program</em>
        to change the language to one the computer can understand without fault.</p>
      </div>
      <br>
        <div class="L1">
        <h3>Python Program</h3>
        <p>The <b>Python Program</b> is a computer program that runs as an interpreter.
        Python translates instructions given in a specific form known as the <b>Backus
        Naur Form</b>. The instructions can be given in sentence form: first Noun, then
        Verb and finally Object. <em>(Sentence = Subject->Verb->Object)</em>. Python
        runs on a <b>variable</b> system. Variables ,in python, are elements that can be
        use to assign a name a specific value. The assignemnt statement goes: Name =
        Expression. 
        </p>
      </div>
      <br>
        <div class="L1">
        <h3>Variables</h3>
        <p>The variables in a python program are a way to give a name a value. To assign
        a value to a variable means that this variable is now a representation of the
        expression.</p>
        <p> The value is assigned using the "=". "=" doesn't mean equal
        like it does in mathematics: In programming, "=" roughly means, "This value is
        now represented by this variable." "2+3=5" is an result of the 2 + 3, but "my_variable=5" now means that ,in the program, my_variable has the value of 5. </p> 
        <p> There are some specifics in dealing with variables: 2+2 and "2"+"2" result
        in two completely diffent results. 2+2 results in 4, because it's formatted as
        a math problem and is asking for addition. "2"+"2" asks what happens when you
        combine "2" and "2", not add them together, so the result is 22.</p>

            <h3>What are Functions</h3>
        <p><b>Functions</b> are programs given to the computer for it to execute.
        Functions require an <b>input</b>, meaning you give the function a value and
        an expression to compute, and the result is an <b>output</b>, or a result of
        the input.({function[(input),(input)]} would yeild an <em>output</em> using the
        keyword "return")  </p>
      </div>
      <br>
          <div class="L1">
            <h3>Making and using Functions</h3>
      <p>To make or <b>define</b> a function, the code has to start with the keyword
      "def". The "def" is then followed by a function name and its <b>parameters</b>.
      The parameters recieve an actual value further down the code, when the is used</p>
      <p>To use, or <b>call</b> a function is to give the parameters a value and run the
      function with those values.
      </p>
       </div>
       <br>
           <div class="L1">
            <h3>Useful but Tricky</h3>
      <p>Functions are a great tool because they help <em><b>avoid repititon</b></em>,
      which is a rule for programmers. Once the function is programmed, it never has to
      be re-programmed and can be used whenever it's needed.
      </p>
      <p>However, functions are still very specific and without the right components,
      the function is useless. An example is the "return" part of the function. Without
      it, absolutely nothing happens. The result that shows up says "None".

            <h3>IF and OR</h3>
      <p>The <b>"IF"</b> statement is used to find a Boolean Value of the given expression
      , or simply wether the expression is <em>True</em> or <em>False</em> within a
      function. The same can be said for the <b>"OR"</b> statement, except the "OR"
      statement can be easier to use by condensing the code.</p>

          <div class="L1">
            <h3>Debugging</h3>
      <p>Bugs. Will. Happen. There are 5 ways to approach debugging a program, and
      anyone will do, it's just based on preference.
        <ol>
           <li>Examine the error messages</li>
           <li>Use an example code as a reference</li>
           <li>Make sure the examples actually work</li>
           <li>Test print intermediate results</li>
           <li>Keep old program attempts for comparison</li>
